Distributed Machine Learning Algorithms in Rust
-----------

### Compilation requirements

* Nightly Rust
* C build environment, for BLAS/LAPACK extensions contained in `ndarray-linalg`. Building on Windows may require some additional setup, see [these instructions](https://github.com/blas-lapack-rs/blas/issues/27#issuecomment-346915404)

### Examples

Example usages of Algorithms are found in `examples/`, which can be run with `cargo run --example <name>`
